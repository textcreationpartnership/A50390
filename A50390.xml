            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Of the <hi>Indians</hi> Inhabiting in <hi>New-England,</hi> and Adjacent Provinces.</head>
            <p>TO ſpeak more of the <hi>Original</hi> of this People, than that they are deſcended from the Loines of their great Grand-father <hi>Adam,</hi> however divers worthy men, have their divers Sentiments; I ſhall not pretend; but that they are Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of <hi>one Language</hi> is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:<note place="margin">Language.</note> nor is the admired knowledge of thoſe Ancients ſo admirable, for their ready ſpeaking more than <hi>Twenty Languages</hi> which may rationally be ſuppoſed to have been, but <hi>one</hi> Originally; though ſuffering ſome change, by ocaſional accidents: we know, the divers pronouncing of the ſame words, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in
<hi>Dialect,</hi> may render the ſpeaker hardly intelligible, to him that writes alike with him; nor do I think the ſpeech of theſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans</hi> ſo divers, but that an <hi>Indian</hi> who is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30764:4"/> well acquainted with <hi>his own,</hi> may by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with
<hi>thoſe,</hi> ſuppoſed of a <hi>different</hi> and <hi>other</hi> ſpeech, promptly Expreſs himſelf in very few years, ſo as to be well underſtood by <hi>Forty</hi> of theſe Nations; who by reaſon of <hi>Wars,</hi> the want of <hi>Traffick</hi> and <hi>Commerce,</hi> and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, other Nations have had by Literature; have ſeverally ſuffered much alteration of that Language, at firſt indifferently ſpoken by all, which yet is not more differing, than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Language of the Engliſh, from their ſpeech not many hundred years ſince; which although it would not readily be underſtood, by a preſent <hi>Londoner,</hi> if he ſhould ſpeak with his great Grand-father, who than lived, yet hath not ſo altered, but no long Converſe, might render them mutually intelligible. Of words not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in the <hi>Indian</hi> Tongue hardly intelligible without cuſtomary diſcourſe of Nation with Nation, I might inſtance in above an hundred; ſuch as <hi>Nuppaw, Duppaw, Ruppaw,</hi> the Sun, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik, Ahtooque &amp;c.</hi> a Deer, <hi>Winnit, Wirrit,</hi> Good, and the like, <hi>Pum, Pum-me, Pim,</hi> Oyl or Fat, theſe and the like, were doubtleſs the ſame words, little altered; beſide which, the alone difference in Pronouncing the ſame word, might ſeem a great difference in the Speech or Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; for Example, <hi>Wirrit</hi> pronounced ſhort, ſounds
<hi>Writ,</hi> and might be not leſs readily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by differently accenting the ſame word; to which I might add, words, as ſuch,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30764:4"/> Expreſſing the mind of the ſpeaker, being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of other words, ſuitable for ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet as ſuch might be called new, or diſtinct from a ſpeech in former uſe; of which words, near the one half of this Peoples Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is. I have been the larger concerning their Language, that ſuch Engliſh whoſe hearts may incline to ſo good and great a work, may be incouraged, to go among thoſe who yet have hardly heard the Name of the LORD, named among them.</p>
            <p>Their Government was purely <hi>Monarchical;</hi> and as for ſuch whoſe dominions extended further than would well admit the Princes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal guidance, it was committed into the hands of
<hi>Lieutenants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Government.</note> who Governed with no leſs abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſs, than the Prince himſelf: notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in matters of difficulty, the
<hi>Prince</hi> Conſulted with his Nobles, and ſuch whom he eſteemed for Wiſdom; in which it was admirable to ſee the Majeſtick deportment of the Prince, his Speech to his Council, with the moſt deliberate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of any matter propoſed for their advice; after which what was by him reſolved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt heſitation was applauded, and with at leſt a ſeeming Alacrity attended.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Crown</hi> (if I may ſo term it) alwayes deſcended to the <hi>Eldeſt Son</hi> (though Subject to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30764:5"/> uſurpation) not to the <hi>Female,</hi> unleſs in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a <hi>Male</hi> of the Blood; the Blood Royal,<note place="margin">Succeſſion.</note> being in ſuch Veneration among this People, that if a Prince had iſſue by divers Wives, ſuch Succeeded as Heir who was Royally deſcended, by the Mother, although the Youngeſt, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his iſſue by a
<hi>Venter</hi> of leſs quallity than a Princeſs, not otherwiſe than <hi>Sachims</hi> or
<hi>Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Nobles</hi> were either ſuch who deſcended from the Blood Royal, or ſuch on whom the Prince beſtowed part of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions with the <hi>Royalties,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nobles.</note> or ſuch whoſe deſcent was from Anceſtors, who had time out of mind been Eſteemed ſuch.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Yeomen</hi> were ſuch who having no ſtamp of <hi>Gentility,</hi> were yet eſteemed as having a natural right of living within their Princes dominion,<note place="margin">Yeomen.</note> and a Common uſe of the <hi>Land,</hi> and were diſtinguiſhed by two Names or Titles, the one ſignifying <hi>Subjection,</hi> the other, <hi>Tiller of the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although this People retained nothing of <hi>Record,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Villians.</note> nor uſe of <hi>Letters,</hi> yet there lived among them many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30764:5"/> who although the time of their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers firſt inhabiting among them, was beyond the Momory of man, yet were known to be <hi>Strangers</hi> or <hi>Forreigners,</hi> who were not Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Common Right,</hi> but in ſome meaſure Subject to the
<hi>Yeomanry,</hi> nor were not dignified, in attending the Prince, in <hi>Hunting</hi> or like Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; unleſs called by particular favour.</p>
            <p>The Princes, as they had not other <hi>Revenue,</hi> than the <hi>Preſents</hi> of their Subjects (which yet was counted, <hi>Due debt) Wrecks</hi> of the Sea,<note place="margin">Revenue.</note> with the <hi>Skin's</hi> of Beaſts killed in their dominion, and many like things, as <hi>Firſt Fruits, &amp;c.</hi> ſo they wanted none; for in caſe of
<hi>War,</hi> both <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Eſtate</hi> was wholly at their diſpoſe; therefore none demanded nor Expected <hi>Pay.</hi> If we reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their <hi>Court,</hi> it was doubtleſs maintained in great Magnificence, in diſtinction from the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> which is the utmoſt can be obtained by the greateſt Monarch; their Families, and attendants being well Cloathed, with <hi>Skins</hi> of <hi>Moos, Bear, Deer, Beaver,</hi> and the like: The Proviſions for their Tables, as <hi>Fleſh, Fiſh, Roots, Fruits, Berries, Corn, Beanes,</hi> in great abundance and variety, was always brought by their Neighbouring Subjects; of all which they were as void of Care, as the moſt Potent Princes in the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:30764:6"/>As the Prince was acknowledged, <hi>Abſolute Lord</hi> on the <hi>Land,</hi> ſo he had no leſs Soveraignty at <hi>Sea:</hi> for as all belonged to him,<note place="margin">Dominion on Seas.</note> which was ſtranded on the Shore of his

<hi>Eighty</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, well Armed, came to Mr. <hi>Mayhew's</hi> Houſe,<note place="margin">Grandure.</note> and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſat down; Mr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> entred the Room, but being acquainted with their Cuſtomes, took no notice of the Prince's being there (it being with them in point of Honour incumbent on the Inferiour to Salute the Superiour:) a conſiderable time being paſt the Prince broke Silence, and ſaid, <hi>Sachem</hi> (a word importing in their Language not more than, Noble, or Worſhipful) <hi>Mr. Mayhew, are you well?</hi> to which having a Friendly reply; and treating of ſeveral things, and of the Iſland
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30764:6"/> 
               <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> being Peopled with Engliſh; the Prince deſiring ſomething wherein the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh were concerned, Mr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> promiſing to effect what he deſired; immediately Subjoyned, that he muſt <hi>Firſt ſpeak with the Inhabitants;</hi> the Prince demanded why he recalled his Promiſe; for ſaid he, <hi>What I Promiſe or Speak is alwayes true, but you Engliſh Governours, cannot be true, for you can't make your words nor intentions true; but mine are alwayes true, for I make them true;</hi> greatly diſdaining the
<hi>Popular Government</hi> of the Engliſh in this Country.</p>
            <p>Having Promiſed an account of the <hi>Converſion</hi> of many <hi>Indians</hi> Inhabiting theſe parts of <hi>America,</hi> it may well be Expected I ſhould ſay ſomething of their
<hi>Religion,</hi> while <hi>Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They generally acknowledged and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>Many gods;</hi> therefore greatly eſteemed and reverenced their <hi>Prieſts, Powaws</hi> or <hi>Wizards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Religion.</note> who were eſteemed as having immediate converſe with the
<hi>gods:</hi> to them therefore they addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all difficult caſes: yet could not all that deſire that <hi>dignity</hi> (as they eſteemed it) obtain
<hi>Familiarity</hi> with the Infernal Spirits; nor were all <hi>Pawaw's</hi> alike Succeſsfull in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes: but they become ſuch either by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation,</hi> or in the uſe of certain <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> Tradition had left as means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to that end: inſomuch that Parents
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30764:7"/> often out of certain Zeal dedicated their Children to the <hi>gods,</hi> and Educated them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, obſerving certain <hi>Diet,</hi> debarring <hi>Sleep &amp;c.</hi> yet of the many thus deſigned, but few obtained their deſire.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing that where the Practice of <hi>Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft</hi> has been highly eſteemed, there may be given the plaineſt demonſtration, of Mortals having Familiarity with <hi>Infernal Spirits;</hi> I am willing to let my Reader know that not many years ſince, dyed here one of the
<hi>Powaw's,</hi> who never pretended to <hi>Aſtrological knowledge,</hi> yet could preciſely inform ſuch who deſire his Aſſiſtance, from whence <hi>Goods Stolen</hi> from them were taken, and whither carryed; with many things of the like nature: nor was he ever known to indeavour the concealing, his knowledge, to be immediately from a <hi>god Subſervient to him, that the Engliſh worſhipped.</hi> This <hi>Powaw</hi> being by an Engliſh man, worthy of Credit (who late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed me of the ſame) deſired to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him, who had Stolen certain Goods which he had loſt, having formerly been an eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ability; the <hi>Powaw</hi> after a little pauſing, demanded why he requeſted that from him, ſince himſelf ſerved another God, that therefore he could not help him; but added, <hi>If you can believe that my god will help you, I will try what I can do;</hi> which diverted the man from further inquity. I muſt a little digreſs, and tell my Reader that this <hi>Powaws</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:30764:7"/> Wife was accounted a Godly Woman, and lived in the practiſe and profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> not only by the approbation, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of her Husband; She conſtantly <hi>Prayed</hi> in the Family, and attended the
<hi>Publick Worſhip</hi> on the Lords Day's: he declared that he could not blame her, for that ſhe Served a God that was above <hi>his;</hi> but that as to himſelf, his gods continued kindneſs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him not to forſake his Service.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Powaw's</hi> by the Infernal Spirits often <hi>killed</hi> Perſons, cauſed
<hi>Lameneſs</hi> and <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> as well as ſhewed their Art in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, beyond <hi>Humane,</hi> by <hi>Diabolick</hi> Skill, ſuch who have converſed much among them have had no reaſon to queſtion.</p>
            <p>Their Practice was, either by deſiring the <hi>Spirit</hi> to them appearing to perform, what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they intended; or to form a piece of <hi>Leather</hi> like an <hi>Arrow head,</hi> tying an hair there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: or uſing ſome <hi>Bone,</hi> as of <hi>Fiſh</hi> (that it might be known Witchcraft, to the bewitched) over which they performed certain <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> and diſmiſſed them to Effect their deſire. Such <hi>Inchanted</hi> things, have moſt certainly, either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the intended to be by them wounded; or the
<hi>Devil</hi> hath formed the like, within their <hi>Fleſh,</hi> without any outward breach of the <hi>Skin;</hi> which we have good reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; the <hi>Powaw's</hi> acknowledging that practice; and ſuch things having been taken out of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30764:8"/> 
               <hi>Fleſh,</hi> of the ſuppoſed to be bewitched. Or, by their Seizing ſomething of the <hi>Spirit</hi> (as the Devil made <hi>them</hi> think) of ſuch they intended to Torment or kill, while it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in their Sleep: this they kept being in Form of a Fly, cloſely impriſoned; and according as they dealt with this, ſo it Fared with the <hi>Body</hi> it belonged to.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the</hi> Cures <hi>performed by them, on the</hi> Bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I could give many inſtances; I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hint at two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The one, of an <hi>Indian</hi> on <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> called afterward <hi>George,</hi> who having been ſome time greatly Tormented, and now wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent; his Friends adviſe him to the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw's,</hi> concluding him to be Bewitched; they being met, and dancing round a great Fire, the Sick lying by; ſome of the Neighbours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Houſe, being perſwaded that a great <hi>Powaw,</hi> now called to cure, had bewitched the Sick: they threaten him that as he had
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,</hi> unleſs he would <hi>Cure</hi> the Sick man, they would burn him in that fire; after many Excuſes, too long here to relate, they took him up, reſolving at leaſt to a little <hi>Singe</hi> him; who no ſooner felt the heat of the fire near him, but the
<hi>Sick</hi> immediately recovered; This was a thing Publickly known to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> as well as <hi>Indians,</hi> in the Neighbourhood: there can be no doubt of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:30764:8"/>The other I ſhall inſtance in, was a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Capt. <hi>Thomas Dagget</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, and <hi>Richard Sarſon</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Juſtices of the Peace; who being on an Iſland, where a Bewitched Woman lay in great Extremity and wholly impotent: the <hi>Powaw's</hi> there having without Succeſs indeavoured the Cure; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated ſent to <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> for more famouſed <hi>Powaw's:</hi> the ſaid Gentlemen, were admitted to be preſent, on certain conditions; the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aw's,</hi> goe to dancing; who with the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, uſed certain <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uſual in ſuch caſes; one of the <hi>Powaw's</hi> Praying to his god, with ſuch ardent deſires and fervency, that Capt. <hi>Dagget</hi> told me, had it been to the true God, it had been a Prayer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding moſt that he had heard: the iſſue was, they in a <hi>Deer Skin</hi> caught the <hi>Spirit</hi> (as they ſaid) which entered the Woman; this they ſaid was the <hi>Spirit</hi> of an
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> drowned in the Adjacent Sound: yet it was then ſuppoſed, the
<hi>Powaw</hi> was by, which bewitched her: the iſſue was, ſhe immediately reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: the
<hi>Powaw</hi> told her, <hi>unleſs ſhe removed to</hi> Martha's Vineyard, <hi>ſhe would again be Sick, for being an Engliſh Spirit he could not long confine it.</hi>

            <p>THE Worſhipful <hi>Thomas Mayhew</hi> in the year 1641. having obtained a grant of

<hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> for the Converſion of theſe Gentiles, ſtirred him up with an Holy Zeal and Reſolution, to Aſſay what Succeſs he might find in that work; he takes opportunity to inſinuate, the <hi>Love</hi> and good will he bore to that People, and ſoon finds Occaſion to let them know their <hi>Deplorable Condition,</hi> under Satan, who as he had kept them in Ignorance of thoſe <hi>Bodily</hi> and <hi>Earthly</hi> things, which might render their Lives in

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30764:11"/> I ſhall give a true Relation, of the Progreſs, and preſent State, of the undertaking, and Gods bleſſing following the indeavours of thoſe he called, for Converting the <hi>Indians,</hi> on <hi>Martha's Vineyard</hi> and Adjacent Iſles; by letting the World know, who, and how qualified theſe were, who were Eſteemed <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When ſuch a <hi>Number</hi> profeſſed the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as gave Occaſion to the <hi>Indians</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to Eſteem them a <hi>Sect</hi> differing from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and by the denomination of, <hi>Praying men,</hi> to Signalize that difference; and that their Number was ſuch as to <hi>Meet Publickly</hi> to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God: ſuch who forſook their Heatheniſh Worſhip and Idolatry, profeſſing to become <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> in the Publick Aſſembly declared, the grounds and reaſons moving them to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the one, and forſake the other way, with their <hi>Reſolution</hi> to <hi>Pray,</hi> to <hi>Serve,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to <hi>Obey</hi> the true God in Jeſus Chriſt; how this <hi>Reſolution</hi> was wrought in them; what <hi>Temptations</hi> had obſtructed, what <hi>Reaſon, Scripture</hi> and
<hi>Strength</hi> from God had incouraged them, and inabled them to retain ſuch
<hi>Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:</hi> how, they had often Prayed to God, and yet been overcome by diſcouragements, and Temptations <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cloſing all with profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Reſolution, by Gods Aſſiſtance, to Pray to, and Serve Him and Him onely; begging the Prayers of the Congregation to God in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30764:11"/> their behalf: which ſaid, many of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation took them by the hand, in token of love and good will. If after ſuch <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profeſſion,</hi> any was obſerved not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the uſual Worſhipping of God, in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Families, deſiring a Bleſſing on their Food, or the like (who yet in their Publick meeting conſtantly attended) they were Publickly Examined of the ſame: Of which let me give a remarkable inſtance: One who after his <hi>Admiſſion</hi> (if I may ſo term it) into the Number and Society of the
<hi>Praying Indians,</hi> being preſent at a great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, after the Exerciſe, was by him that Preached, informed that it was reported, he had ceaſed to Pray, deſired him, to let the Congregation know, what grounds and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives occaſioned ſuch neglect; the man anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>It was true, he had not lately uſed Publickly to Pray; yet did ſometimes Pray Privately; that he did not in his judgement diſapprove the Service of God, but acknowledged it to be good; but found himſelf weak; not able to live up to Rules of that Religion: but when God ſhould give him more ſtrength, he hoped he ſhould be again a Praying man.</hi>

<hi>England;</hi> but alas, the Ship wherein he took Paſſage was never heard of; Thus came to an Immature Death, Mr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> who was ſo Affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed of by the
<hi>Indians,</hi> that many years after, he was ſeldom named without Tears.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:30764:12"/>Mr. <hi>Thomas Mayhew,</hi> after the loſs of his Son, as aforeſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Seeing no ſuch <hi>Salary,</hi> probably to be obtained, that might invite a Miniſter to imbrace the work among the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> and little hopes of finding any of the Spirit of his Son, or Mr. <hi>ELIOT;</hi> to bear the burthen, attending, and in that day of neceſſity to be undergone; without a proſpect of more than could well be expected, for incouraging to ſo in-it-ſelf-troubleſome imploy; and that his onely Son, had ſpent his Strength, and yet rejoyced in the mid'ſt of thoſe many Aches, Pain's and Diſtempers, contracted by his often lodging in their cold houſes, and induring Wet and Cold, in faith of Gods accepting of, and proſpering him in that, whereunto he could ſee nothing could rationally move him; concludes that it was, <hi>Of God, and not of man;</hi> he therefore reſolves to Viſit and incourage them often; he goes once every Week to ſome of their Plantations; and with the Aſſiſtance of Godly <hi>Indians</hi> who taught and inſtructed their Neighbours, on the Lords Day's, perſwaded the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> who many years, were obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to admit the <hi>Glad-Tidings</hi> of the Goſpel among them (being animated by the <hi>Sachims</hi> of the Continent) now to imbrace it; ſo that now the <hi>Indians</hi> on the

            <p>During the late unhappy War between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> in
<hi>New-England,</hi> about Nineteen years ſince; an <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> poſſeſſed too many of our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whereby they ſuffered themſelves to be unreaſonably exaſperated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all <hi>Indians;</hi> of ſuch there were ſome on theſe Iſlands, who could hardly be ſo moderated by Mr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> and others in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with him, as to be reſtrained from riſing to aſſay the diſarming of the Indians; for whoſe ſatisfaction Capt. <hi>Richard Sarſon</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was ordered with a ſmall party (the Indians being on theſe Iſlands Twenty to one, having
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:30764:18"/> Arms) to Treat the Indians on the Weſt end of <hi>Martha's Vineyard,</hi> who were moſtly to be doubted: he returns with the inſuing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: that the delivering their Arms would expoſe them to the will of the <hi>Indians</hi> ingaged in the preſent War, who were not leſs theirs than the Enemies of the Engliſh; that they had never given occaſion of the
<hi>diſtruſt</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated; if in any thing not hazarding their ſafety, they could give any Satisfaction for proof of their <hi>Fidelity,</hi> they would willingly attend what ſhould reaſonably be demanded of them; but they were unwilling to deliver their Arms, unleſs the Engliſh would propoſe ſome mean for their ſafety and livelyhood: with this return they drew a <hi>Writing</hi> in their own Language, which I have often read, and would have <hi>Verbatim</hi> inſerted, but cannot at preſent find it; the Subſtance was, that as they had Submitted to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> ſo they reſolved to <hi>Aſſiſt the Engliſh</hi> on theſe Iſlands againſt <hi>their</hi> Enemies, which they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame reſpect equally
<hi>their own,</hi> as Subjects to the ſame <hi>King;</hi> which was Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the Perſons of greateſt note among them.</p>
            <p>Having this anſwer, the Government reſolved, and accordingly improved them as a guard, furniſhing them with ſuitable Amunition, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:30764:19"/> found them ſo faithful that even ſome neerly related, in obſervance of general inſtructions given them, ſo ſoon as they landed from the Continent, were immediately brought before the Governour, to attend his pleaſure; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (although the War, with reſpect to the multitude of Indians inhabiting the Continent, and their advantage by the neerneſs to the <hi>French</hi> had no good aſpect) took no care, but left the whole to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> nothing doubting to be advertiſed by them of any danger from the Enemy. This was the effect of the bringing the <hi>Goſpel of Peace</hi> among them, <hi>Viz. a Peace-bringing Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other obſervable I ſhall add to ſhow as their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> ſo their obſervance of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>In the time of the late <hi>Revolution,</hi> when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in hopes there was <hi>no King in Iſrael,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have done what they ſaw good in their own eyes: Several of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to fetch certain <hi>Sheep</hi> in poſſeſſion of the Indians inhabiting a ſmall Iſland Adjacent to <hi>Martha's Vineyard;</hi> which Sheep they aſſerted were Stolen from them, who met with repulſe; the <hi>Sachim</hi> leaſt there ſhould happen any miſunderſtanding of that matter, immediately
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30764:19"/> makes his report to me in theſe words, <hi>Viz. Several of your Engliſh have been on my Iſland, and would have forceably taken Sheep from thence; and we are much threatned therewith; I am doubtfull if they perſiſt in that Reſolution, it may Occaſion Blood-ſhed: you know that while your Grand-father and my Father lived, there never happened any difference in ſuch things, nor hope will be Occaſion given by me. I deſire the ſame Amity may be continued, nor can the Engliſh ſay that we have not manifeſted our Allegiance to the King by a continued Subjection. And although it is true, we have deſired your Order ſhould come to us, rather than your Officer, which hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally been obſerved; yet we are willing in Caſe the Engliſh pretend any thing, ours have injured them in; let an Officer by writ from Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doe his duty; then we ſhall know how in an orderly way, to be relieved; yet ſhall the leaſt Boy bringing your Order, as in your Grandfathers time, Command any thing: and if you ſee cauſe on any complaint about our Sheep, you may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all of them; hoping to find as hitherto a deciſion by the Rules of Juſtice: we hope we ſhall not ſee (as is too much practiced in other places) an Engliſh man, pretending an Indian to be in his debt to come to our Houſes and pay himſelf; or in other caſes beat our People; but as hitherto we may have equal Juſtice, being the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and Violence and Riot committed on our
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30764:20"/> People by the Engliſh may be eſteemed of the ſame nature and quality as ours againſt them; of which, with the Juſtices, we pray you would Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and take ſpeedy care.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall as to their <hi>Government</hi> only add; that in their ſeveral <hi>Plantations</hi> or <hi>Town-ſhips,</hi> they Elect <hi>three</hi> or more to joyn with the <hi>Sachims</hi> (or Lords of the place) who hold <hi>Courts,</hi> for iſſuing ſuch Controverſies as happen among them, the <hi>Sachim</hi> preſiding in ſuch Courts, or in caſe <hi>he</hi> decline that Office, another is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in his place: if either party diſlike the Judgment given, he Appeals to a <hi>Superiour Court,</hi> which conſiſts of ſome of the moſt eſteemed of each place, being ſome of their <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> where ſome <hi>Principal Sachims</hi> is Elected to preſide for one year: and from this Court an Appeal lyes to the <hi>Engliſh Court.</hi> In giving Judgment, they obſerve ſuch rules and orders made and recorded among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the <hi>Engliſh Law,</hi> the knowledge whereof they much aſpire unto. They have likewiſe ſome among them, whom the leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to declare, or defend their own Caſes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove as
<hi>Attornies;</hi> ſome of which are to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration <hi>Critical</hi> in their pleadings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:30764:20"/>I ſhall cloſe the whole when I have told the Reader, that their Children are generally taught to <hi>Read,</hi> and many to <hi>Write;</hi> in one of their Towns the laſt Winter, <hi>Viz.</hi> 1693. <hi>Thirty Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> were at School, Twenty more of the ſame place, at the ſame time, accidentally, being not ſupplyed with Books, could not attend it.

                        <p>YOurs I Received, and Rejoyce that God hath Stirred up any that doth take care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the advancing Chriſts Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Poor Heathen; and do and did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly believe, that where God ſends Light, He intends Love; and where God gives little, He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects leſs; and therefore the Labours of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Mr. Eliot, Mr. Mayhew</hi> &amp;c. have not been loſt, they have not Run in vain, but that many are gone to Heaven of their deceaſed hearers. And I ſhould count it my Joy and Crown to win one Soul of them to Chriſt. And am in hope that ſome one or two of the <hi>Pecuots,</hi> that were my Friends and lived on my Land, upon my endeavour have obtained Mercy, now dead, who dyed Praying, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced wholly the way of the Heathen Worſhip &amp;c. Alſo ſome of our Captive Servants profeſſing the Faith with many Tears are Baptized, and give good Teſtimony in their Knowledge, Converſe and Converſation of a real Gracious work upon them. I have in my Houſe a Witty hopefull <hi>Sachems Son,</hi> one of the chiefeſt quality in theſe parts, bound faſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30764:26"/> to me to be inſtructed to <hi>Read</hi> and <hi>Write,</hi> and in the way of Life, which hitherto gives great hopes, and no diſcouragement; he is about <hi>Thirteen</hi> Years of Age. And once I had the advantage to Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh many of the Heathen, and of the chief of them, by Gods anſwering Prayers in the preſence of many Heathen, by raiſing a very Sick
<hi>Indian Lad (Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh alſo preſent)</hi> after the Lad was given over by <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and was Speechleſs; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Powaw's</hi> had <hi>Powawed,</hi> and given that Sentence, that the <hi>Lad</hi> would Dy; but he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live to this day: The Story is too large to write, but I believe God did Glorify Himſelf in the ſight of the Heathen, according to Humble and Earneſt Petitions, made in the preſence of about <hi>Thirty</hi> Heathen: all ſeemed to be much Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and awakened. One very Witty and Wiſe
<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> there preſent told me, he would be a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> but he was afraid his heart would not be right, without which Profeſſion would be in vain, and he was afraid
<hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> would be his Ruine, he ſhould not for-bear, but he owned and almoſt all preſent, when I Prayed, Our God was the Great and true God, but they were Poor
<hi>Indians,</hi> and they did not know Him. Of theſe things and much more many
<hi>Engliſh</hi> witneſſes are alive, but ſome are dead. I have heard alſo the Reverend
<hi>Mr. Fitch</hi> did at the Requeſt of the <hi>Mohegs,</hi> keep a <hi>Faſt</hi> for

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:30764:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>Mr. <hi>Thomas Tupper</hi> alſo has given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>One hundred &amp; Eighty Indians,</hi> unto whom he do's diſpenſe the word, concerning whom he ha's Charitable hopes that they do (and that with Zeal and Sincerity) Embrace the Goſpel. There are moreover, in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony about <hi>Five Hundred Indians,</hi> amongſt whom Mr.
<hi>John Cotton</hi> (Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and Son to the Famous
<hi>Cotton</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi>) hath and doth Preach the Goſpel. Likewiſe Mr. <hi>Peter Thatcher,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Milton,</hi> is a Faithful Labourer amongſt the
<hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Punkepaog.</hi> So is Mr. <hi>Grindal Rawſon,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Mendam,</hi> among the <hi>Indians</hi> in thoſe Parts; and Mr. <hi>Bondet,</hi> who is Miniſter to the French Congregation at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the <hi>Nipmug</hi> Country. The
